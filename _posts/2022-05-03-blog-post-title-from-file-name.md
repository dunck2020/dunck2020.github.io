# Team Reflections:
I think I can speak for everyone on the team when I say it was a great
feeling to have a working published product.  When we worked out all of
the bugs, after the initial deploy I could hear the excitement in 
everyone's voices.  This is quite a mile stone for junior developers
to have published a working e-commerce website. 

# Personal Reflections:
I really enjoyed the team atmosphere on the final push.  When we first 
published the app, there was an issue.  Colin, Nate, Neal and I had the 
problem figured out within minutes.  Same with the next issue, we had
it solved in minutes.  This really opened my eyes to the power of a
team working together.  I feel very proud of myself and all of the team
members for putting this project together.  Maybe in the future there
will be another project that a few of us can work on again.
