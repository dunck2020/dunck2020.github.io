## Sprint 3 Blog

# Team Reflections:
I feel as a team, in sprint 3 that we realized how much more work we actually have to do.
The meeting with Frank was somewhat of an eye opener.  The team has been working
great and completing as many tasks as they can.  It is also noted that many of us
have different techniques for coding a ASP.NET app, so the abstract work for each
of us has been interesting.

# Personal Reflections:
The real coding work has now began, I feel there is a lot more to do, and I think it 
would be great if we can set some milestones so we can all review the pages we have
built.  Discuss openly what we like and what we don't like.  The views must all share
responsiveness and cohesion.  Sprint 4 will be the most challenging yet.
