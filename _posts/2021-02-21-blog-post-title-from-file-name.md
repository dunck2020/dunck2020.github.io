## Sprint 1 Blog

# Team Reflections:
I really feel the team has a lot of talent and we are going to produce a great product.  
Every member of the team wants to fulfill their obligations.  I look forward to putting all 
of our experince together and producing a product that Yanke Design is happy with.

# Personal Reflections:
Personally I feel like I could have done more this sprint, but it is hard to find something 
to do when there is really no assignment.  Some teammates would just grab something and start 
working on it, which eventually we all did, but it kind of leaves me wondering what will 
happen when there is a lot more meat to what we have to do.  Overall I'm pleasantly surprised 
about the dynamic of the team
