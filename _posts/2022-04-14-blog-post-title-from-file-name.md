## Sprint 4 Blog

# Team Reflections:
A lot of work was completed in Sprint 4.  The team really came together and
everyone did their part.  Moving forward I think it will be mostly small
tweaks here and there and making sure the client is happy.

# Personal Reflections:
I am excited to be done with this sprint.  There were a lot of issues that
I took a while to figure out, and still some things I'm not entirely
happy with.  The ability to see a work that we have all put time and
effort into really makes me happy.
