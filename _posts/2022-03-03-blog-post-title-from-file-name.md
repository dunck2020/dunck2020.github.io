## Sprint 2 Blog

# Team Reflections:
The team is really moving quickly.  Everyone is picking up tasks and finishing them well 
ahead of time.  I feel that every member is pulling their weight and contributing.
Everyone has some different ideas or philosophy for doing certain things and it adds a 
great dynamic to work with.  

# Personal Reflections:
This sprint is still part of the planning stages so most of the work is diagrams, process
flows and other creative design.  I find some of this work tedious but it is all
part of software creation.  Looking forward to spring 3.
